# Aliveness Monitoring Example
 
This example discusses how Service and Protocol Monitoring can be implemented using Eiffel event.

# Introduction
 
In a continuous integration and delivery pipeline, the availability of the IT/Cloud infrastructure & Services that interact with the pipeline are critical components for the availability of CI/CD activities & productivity.
For example, what if a Cloud environment orchestrator became unavailable due to an unplanned/unforeseen incident, how would this outage impact the dynamic creation or removal of resoures for the CI/CD?
Or suppose that the target of your artifact's deployment suddenly lost storage connectivity, how would this affect the CI/CD, would it fail and require manual intervention to get it back up and running?
Wouldnâ€™t it be good if this type of information was made readily available to your CI/CD automatically, so that contingency plans may be implemented to prevent something breaking or to at least mitigate the impact of an outage affecting the CI/CD.
Facilitating for the integration of observational activities and subsequent notification into a CI/CD in an automated fashion is highly desirable.
This may be achieve by utilizing the EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR) and EiffelAlertAcknowledgedEvent (AlerA) as a synchronous partner pair.
For example, suppose there is an activity that publishes an EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR) containing information that something has happened (e.g Service A is down) which is subsequently consumed and triggers another activity that publishes an EiffelAlertAcknowledgedEvent  acknowledging that Service A is down ("first responder" acknowledgement).
The first responder entity may for example be used to trigger subsequent Activities to resolve the impact of "Service A is down" or may be used to pause your CI/CD activity until a  EiffelAlertCeasedEvent (AlerC) is published with information stating a modified status of Service A (e.g "Service A is Alive") indicating that the problem has been resolved.

## Event Graph
![alt text](./aliveness-monitoring.png "Event Graph of aliveness monitroring Example")



# Event-by-Event Explanation

# ActT1
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent (ActT), representing that monitoring activities has been triggered.

# AlerR
EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR) in this example representing an announcement that something has happened (e.g Service A is down). Using it's CAUSE link, the EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR) declares that it is part of the previous monitoring Activity.

# ActT2
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent (ActT) in this example representing that monitoring activities have been triggered as a result of the previous EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR). Using it CAUSE link, the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvents ActT2 declares a link to EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR).

# AlerA
EiffelAlertAcknowledgedEvent (AlerA) in this example representing the acknowledgement of the EiffelAlertRaisedEvent. Using it CAUSE link, the EiffelAlertAcknowledgedEvent (AlerA) declares that is part of the previous activity and is CAUSED by EiffelAlertRaisedEvent (AlerR).

# ActT3
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent(ActT), in this example representing triggering activities. Using its CAUSE link, the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvents ActT3 declares that it is CAUSED by EiffelAlertAcknowledgedEvent (AlerA).

# AlerC1
The EiffelAlertCeasedEvent (AlerC) in this example representing an incident which was ongoing (e.g an IT Infrastruture failure) has now come to an end and has ceased.
